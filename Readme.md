* Create Cards within the deck?
  - Is there more than one way to create a card or maybe even decks?
  - The Create Card button should be on the ViewDeck.. flow.
- Reusable components for the forms?
- Edit/update deck and cards?

## At this point
- We know we can create a card from the view deck screen

---

- [x] Delete Deck
  - [ ] I am currently passing down a removeDeck
        property that is a function. The remove deck is defined in the Layout component.
        Passed through Layout to Home to Decks to Deck. From Layout to ViewDeck.
  - [ ] Does this implicitly delete the cards?
- [x] Created the ability to Create Decks
- [ ] Consider a reusable form for create and edit

[x] I can View a deck and all the cards contained within

[x] Start to leave breadcrumbs

- [x] I will create bread crumbs in its own folder
- [x] I created a semifunctional bread crumb component
  - Works best for study workflow
- [ ] I will return to the full Impementation of this

[x] At this point I can study decks...

- go through cards
- flip cards
- restart cards
